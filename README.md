#### Eduford University Clone

#### by Raunak Sharma

<h2>Why This project was chosen ?</h2>
The aim of any university website is to provide information in a clear and accessible format, promoting the best user experience possible. 
I build this website because it has multiple pages with the help of Html web component i create reusable components without using things like React ,This is a one webpage template regarding to information about the university and also it is responsive by nature with some hover effect  and  it is  HTML CSS mini project but little bit JAVASCRIPT used in a project for some necessary requirement for mobile screen


<h2> HOW did i make the project ? </h2>
Web Components are actually a collection of a few different technologies that allow you to create custom HTML elements.

Those technologies are:

HTML templates: Fragments of HTML markup using <template> elements that won't be rendered until they're appended to the page with JavaScript.
Custom elements: Widely supported JavaScript APIs that let you create new DOM elements. Once you create and register a custom element using these APIs, you can use it similarly to a React component.
Shadow DOM: A smaller, encapsulated DOM that is isolated from the main DOM and rendered separately. Any styles and scripts you create for your custom components in the Shadow DOM will not affect other elements in the main DOM.


<h2>WHAT features, technical things had been implemented here?</h2>
basically in this project Html and css and JavaScript is used here <b>Web Component</b> that allow you to create custom HTML elements , Lifecycle Callbacks  <b>connectedCallback</b> to append component data to UI and use <b>Shadow Dom</b> with <b>Custom Elements.</b>
